- What is your full name, uID, and tutorial? (15 secs)

My name is Tian Wu. My UID is u7075880, and my tutorial starts from 9 to 11 am on Tuesday.

- Describe a project or situation where you have had to work as part of a team. What was your role, and how did you contribute to the overall objective? (1.30 mins)

(Situation) At the beginning of this semester, I got in touch with some friends who were also struggling to pick up basic knowledge about Java language and more broadly, programming. After meeting on campus several times, we decide to set up an online group on GitHub as a platform for this team. The project focuses on future discussions and code reviews, and the ultimate goal is that everyone involved can improve him/herself and inspire others. We call it the miniGroup project.

(Role) My leading role in this project is an organiser or facilitator.

(How) More specifically, I arrange the weekly meeting via zoom for everyone to participate in. For example, usually, I post a poll of available time periods for everyone to vote. The poll is conducted in a group chat one week in advance. Meanwhile, I make a draft on the topics that will be addressed during the next meeting. I contact every member of this project to get more suggestions and make sure that every aspect is covered and everyone is motivated. The goal is to encourage every member to get his hands on this real project and improve the programming skills through coding and working together. 

- Describe a technical or professional competency you demonstrated or developed while working on this project. (The competency needs to align with industry expectations from Engineers Australia (EA) Stage 1 Competency Standards (ENGN students) or the Skills Framework for the Information Age (SFIA) (COMP students). (1.30 mins)

(Technical/Professional competency) The professional competency I've developed while working on this miniGroup project is *taking initiatives to keep skills up to date*. I come from a background of science in physics, and members in our team all have their backgrounds rather than computer science. But here we are, aiming to polish up skills in the area of computer science. One of the fundamental advantages of the computing industry is that everyone has access to all kinds of state-of-the-art technologies and tools. When starting this project, I barely know anything about git control. However, the power of git and GitHub motivates me to use it on a daily basis. So I decide to take initiatives to learn more about this new tool, and as the semester goes on, I integrate my experience in git and GitHub with our group project. For instance, I take advantage of GitHub to streamline our project. As you may know, GitHub has efficient templates such as Kanban System and Bug Triage System that make organising group project easier. Therefore, I immediately pick up these new skills and create a child project within our group to keep track of the process as well as to raise issues for group discussion. The initiatives I take turn out to be inspiring. As a result, every member of our group benefits from the new skills. 

- Give me a specific example relating to the project you worked on where you needed to use good judgement in solving a complex technical or professional problem. What did you learn as a professional? (1.30 mins)

(Example of good judgement) It occurs to me that one time, a team member spotted a serious bug in our project, and the task was due the very next morning. Therefore, as an organiser of this group project, I had to use good judgement to conquer this problem as soon as possible. So I decided to call for an urgent Zoom meeting immediately to get opinions from members of our team. Everyone involved presented his ideas for discussion. Afterwards, with efficient communication and involvement, I was able to make a detailed plan for everyone to test his code on his own git branch accordingly. Each member is designated with a special task to tackle this bug in a short time. Once there was a breakthrough, I need to integrate the new information and update the project and inform others. Luckily, we nailed this bug just before the deadline. 

(Professional) The lesson I have learned from solving this technical problem is consisted of three parts: communication, scheduling and absorption of new information. First of all, fluent communication, both orally and in writing is the key to a successful task. Second, proper plans are essential for everyone to meet time and targets. Last but not least, as the task develops, rapid absorption of new information is crucial to ensure the efficiency of the group project. 

- How do you see your skills and competencies contributing to the PP1 project team this semester? (30 secs)

(Contributions) First of all, the communication skills I've acquired are good for organising the team project. Communicating effectively both orally and in writing is essential for PP1 project to succeed, and everyone needs to take an active part in communicating with each other. Second, I'm good at scheduling events to ensure the steady progress of the team project. Plans, schedules and monitoring are significant for every team member to improve himself and keep the project on track. Last but not least, I am proactive in learning and applying new skills to contribute to our team project. Taking initiatives not only motivates me to polish up skills but also it efficiently facilitates the PP1 project until we achieve the final goal.
