How Wi-Fi works

Target audience: a 3rd year uni student.

Nowadays, Wi-Fi is everywhere in our lives. Our phones, tablets and computers all use Wi-Fi to transmit data through the Internet. 
But first of all, what is Wi-Fi? According to Wikipedia, Wi-Fi is a family of wireless networking technologies based on the IEEE 802 family of standards, and it's also a trademark of the non-profit Wi-Fi Alliance. 
Then, how does Wi-Fi work? 
We all know that frequencies can carry much information. For example, the radio station sends out signal frequencies in Kilohz and MegaHz so we can listen to the music when our receiver devices decode that frequency information. 
The same principle applies to Wi-Fi technology as well. Generally speaking, Wi-Fi uses the radio frequencies to send signals between devices. As you may notice, when you buy new digital products, usually the devices using Wi-Fi support the frequencies of both 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz. The critical part here is the Wi-Fi chip integrated within electronic devices. More specifically, when you use your iPhone to chat with your friend, the integrated Wi-Fi chip converts all the information represented by 0's and 1's into radio waves to the router and in the meantime, decoding all the frequency waves from the router to 0's and 1's so your iPhone can understand. 
Furthermore, when your device connects to the Wi-Fi, the router automatically sets up a specific channel for your device to communicate based on the waveband Wi-Fi is using. In this way, Wi-Fi technology can balance the traffic through the wireless network between different connected devices. However, sometimes with too many devices connected to the same router via Wi-Fi, all channels are used up, so delays do occur in transmitting signals just like the traffic jam in the rush hour when everyone is driving.
